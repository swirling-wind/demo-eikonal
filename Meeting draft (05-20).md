## DIfficulties
- I've read your journal "The State of the Art in Interactive Global Illumination". And in its comparison section, it marked Eikonal rendering method as very hard to implement. It sounds a bit scaring.

- I also find the original Eikonal rendering paper's codebase and I tried to understand it but failed. It consists of 38,000 lines of old-version C/C++ code, not including the code of the nrEngine it uses, which hasn't been maintained for the past ten years.

- Because of the distinctiveness of the data structure of Eikonal rendering, maybe I cannot rely on any existing rendering engine and I'd better implement it from scratch so I can better customize it. Is it correct?

- What is the relationship between Eikonal rendering and photon mapping?


## Request
- Is it possible to introduce one of your students to help and answer some of my techinical questions when I'm working on it. I understand your busy schedule and sorry for my disturbing. This would be very helpful and ensure faster guidance. I really appreciate any assistance you could coordinate if possible.
